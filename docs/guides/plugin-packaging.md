# Argos Plugin Packaging

This guide documents `.dcplugin` packaging for official Argos plugins bundled with Argos
release packages.

## Package Format

A `.dcplugin` file is a zip archive built from one plugin directory.

Required files:

- `plugin.json`: hydrated manifest used by the installer.
- `checksums.json`: SHA-256 checksums for packaged files.
- every file declared by manifest skills and settings contributions.
- runtime payloads required by the target platform and architecture.

The packager excludes development-only sources such as `vendor/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`,
`.build/`, `.DS_Store`, and symlinks.

Official packages keep Argos release asset URLs in their manifest metadata:

```text
https://github.com/dvaJi/argos/releases/download/v<version>/<asset-name>.dcplugin
```

Output naming pattern: `argos-plugin-<name>-<version>[-<platform>-<arch>].dcplugin`

## Generic Commands

All plugins share a common set of commands powered by `scripts/plugin.mjs`, which delegates to
`scripts/package-plugin.mjs` for the actual packaging logic.

### Validate

Dry-run: validates the manifest and file references without producing a `.dcplugin`.

```bash
pnpm run plugin:validate -- --name <plugin> --platform <platform> --arch <arch>
```

### Package

Build (if the plugin has a native build step) and package into a `.dcplugin` under `dist/plugins/`.

```bash
pnpm run plugin:package -- --name <plugin> --platform <platform> --arch <arch>
```

### Bundle

Package into `build/bundled-plugins/` for embedding into the Electron app.

```bash
pnpm run plugin:bundle -- --name <plugin> --platform <platform> --arch <arch>
```

### Verify

Verify expected bundled official plugin artifacts from plugin metadata.

```bash
pnpm run plugin:verify -- --name <plugin> --platform <platform> --arch <arch> --plugin-root <plugins-dir>
```

When `--name` is omitted, the script verifies all official plugins supported by the target platform.

### Clean

Remove all bundled plugin artifacts:

```bash
pnpm run plugin:bundle:clean
```

## Plugins with Native Build Steps

Some plugins (like CUA) include pre-compiled native binaries. These require an additional build
step before packaging. The dispatcher script automatically detects and runs
`scripts/build-<name>-plugin-runtime.mjs` when it exists.

CUA native build commands (macOS-only, requires Swift toolchain):

```bash
pnpm run plugin:cua:build              # host architecture
pnpm run plugin:cua:build:mac:arm64    # explicit ARM64
pnpm run plugin:cua:build:mac:x64      # explicit x64
```

## CUA Plugin Artifacts

The CUA plugin ships one macOS helper app per CPU architecture. The bundled package filename
includes both platform and architecture:

```text
argos-plugin-cua-<version>-darwin-arm64.dcplugin
argos-plugin-cua-<version>-darwin-x64.dcplugin
```

Runtime detection inside the package uses architecture-specific paths:

```text
plugin:runtime/darwin/<arch>/Argos Computer Use.app/Contents/MacOS/cua-driver
```

Each `.dcplugin` contains only the runtime directory for its target architecture.

## Output Locations

Standalone packages:

```text
dist/plugins/
```

Bundled packages (embedded into the Electron app):

```text
build/bundled-plugins/
```

## CI and Release

The build matrix in `.github/workflows/build.yml` bundles plugins before running `electron-builder`
on every platform:

- **macOS**: bundles the CUA plugin (with native build).
- **Linux**: CUA is macOS-only; no `.dcplugin` is bundled.
- **Windows**: CUA is macOS-only; no `.dcplugin` is bundled.

Electron Builder embeds `.dcplugin` files from `build/bundled-plugins/` into:

```text
<app>/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/plugins/     (macOS)
<app>/resources/app.asar.unpacked/plugins/               (Windows/Linux)
```

Each matrix job verifies the expected bundled `.dcplugin` files exist inside the app before
uploading artifacts.

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) repeats the same steps. Final release
uploads app artifacts only; `.dcplugin` files are not published as separate GitHub Release assets.

Expected embedded files (macOS example):

```text
app.asar.unpacked/plugins/argos-plugin-cua-<version>-darwin-x64.dcplugin
app.asar.unpacked/plugins/argos-plugin-cua-<version>-darwin-arm64.dcplugin
```

## Adding a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/plugin.json` with required fields (`id`, `name`, `version`, `publisher`,
   `source`, `engines.platforms`, skills, settings contributions).
2. If the plugin needs a native build step, create `scripts/build-<name>-plugin-runtime.mjs`.
3. Test locally: `pnpm run plugin:validate -- --name <name> --platform <platform> --arch <arch>`
4. Add bundling commands to the CI workflows for the relevant platforms.
5. Add verification steps to CI to confirm the `.dcplugin` is embedded in the built app.
